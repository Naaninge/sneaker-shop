# Frontend Mentor - E-commerce Product Page Solution

Welcome to my solution for the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). This project provided a valuable opportunity for me to enhance my coding skills by tackling a realistic project.

- Clearly defined hover states for interactive elements
- Utilization of a lightbox gallery triggered by clicking on the large product image
- Dynamic switching of the large product image through interaction with small thumbnail images
- Ability to add items to the cart
- Cart functionality to view and remove items
